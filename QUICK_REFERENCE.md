## 💎 Golden Phrases (Memorize These!)

### On the problem:
> "15 hours of WhatsApp outreach means a lot of context switching between Salesforce and WhatsApp. I wanted to remove that friction."

### On the solution:
> "One click, and I'm in WhatsApp with a pre-filled message. No copy-pasting."

### On AI:
> "The AI never sees the student's name, phone, or email—only the context: their program, country, and last interaction."

### On privacy:
> "This approach ensures we can use AI tools safely without putting the university at risk of FERPA or data protection violations."

### On impact:
> "That's 5-7 hours saved per week. But more importantly, those hours are **reallocated** to meaningful conversations with students who reply."

### Closing:
> "I built this in a weekend to show you I understand the workflow, not just the job description. Imagine what I could build with a full semester."

## 🚨 If She Says...

| **She Says** | **You Say** |
|--------------|-------------|
| "We already have a tool for this" | "That's great! This complements your existing workflow and the skills are transferable to other projects." |
| "How much does this cost?" | "Gemini has a generous free tier—about 1,500 messages/day. Even at scale, it's ~$0.0002 per message." |
| "What about data security?" | "Runs locally on your machine. Only non-personal data (program/country) goes to AI when you click 'Generate.'" |
| "This seems complicated" | "It's actually simpler than the current process—fewer clicks, fewer tabs, less context switching." |
| "What if we don't want to use AI?" | "No problem! The template-based workflow alone saves significant time. AI is optional." |
