## 🎯 The 3 Things Andrea MUST See

### 1. The Privacy Indicator (Your Differentiator)
**When**: Toggle AI ON
**What to say**: 
> "The AI never sees the student's name, phone, or email—only the context: their program, country, and last interaction."

### 2. The Time Savings (Your Value)
**When**: After showing the basic workflow
**What to say**:
> "This saves 5-7 hours per week. But more importantly, those hours are reallocated to meaningful conversations with students who reply."

### 3. The Initiative (Your Character)
**When**: Closing statement
**What to say**:
> "I built this in a weekend to show you I understand the workflow, not just the job description. Imagine what I could build with a full semester."

## 💡 If Something Goes Wrong

### "The app won't start"
- Check: Is Node.js running?
- Try: `npm install` then `npm run dev` again

### "AI generation fails"
- Check: `.env.local` has correct API key
- Show: "The template mode still works!" (demonstrate resilience)

### "WhatsApp doesn't open"
- Say: "In production, this would open WhatsApp Web. The key is the one-click integration, not the specific app."

### "She cuts you off"
- Stay calm: "No problem! The main point is [privacy/time savings]. Would you like to see [other feature]?"

### "She's not impressed"
- Pivot: "Even if this exact tool isn't needed, the approach—understanding workflows, building solutions, prioritizing privacy—is what I'd bring to any project."

Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. I really enjoyed learning more about INTO SLU and the Marketing & Recruitment team's goals.

As promised, here's the Local Outreach Hub tool I demonstrated: [GitHub link if you have one]

I especially appreciated your insights on [something specific she mentioned]. It reinforced my excitement about potentially joining the team and helping streamline your student outreach efforts.

The 20-hour role aligns perfectly with my schedule, and I'm eager to bring both creativity (UGC content) and technical problem-solving to INTO's mission.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to see any customizations to the tool.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
