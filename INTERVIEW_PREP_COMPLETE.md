### Key Phrases to Memorize

**On Privacy:**
> "The AI never sees the student's name, phone, or email—only the context: their program, country, and last interaction."

**On Impact:**
> "That's 5-7 hours saved per week. But more importantly, those hours are reallocated to meaningful conversations with students who reply."

**Closing:**
> "I built this in a weekend to show you I understand the workflow, not just the job description. Imagine what I could build with a full semester."
